# Implementation Plan for Trimp (TypeScript Port of Primp)

## Phase 1: Project Setup
- Initialize TypeScript project with `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`.
- Set up directory structure: `src/`, `tests/`, `docs/`.
- Install dependencies: `typescript`, `jest`, `@types/node`, etc.
- Configure linting and formatting with ESLint and Prettier.

## Phase 2: Core HTTP Client Implementation
- Implement base `Client` class with synchronous methods using Node.js `http`/`https`.
- Add `AsyncClient` with Promise-based async methods.
- Implement request/response handling: headers, body, JSON, forms.
- Add basic error handling and timeouts.

## Phase 3: Impersonation Features
- Research and implement browser/OS fingerprinting (TLS JA3/JA4, headers).
- Integrate impersonation parameters into client constructors.
- Test impersonation against known sites (e.g., tls.peet.ws).

## Phase 4: Advanced Features
- Add cookie management with `tough-cookie`.
- Implement proxy support (HTTP/SOCKS5).
- Add authentication (basic/Bearer).
- Support streaming responses and multipart uploads.
- Environment variable handling.

## Phase 5: Utilities and Convenience
- Implement module-level convenience functions.
- Add HTML-to-text conversion for response methods.
- Custom CA certificate support.

## Phase 6: Testing and Quality Assurance
- Write unit tests for all classes and methods.
- Integration tests for impersonation and real requests.
- Performance benchmarks against original primp if possible.
- Code review and linting.

## Phase 7: Documentation and Packaging
- Write comprehensive README with API docs and examples.
- Generate TypeScript definitions.
- Publish to npm.
- Update AGENTS.md with project-specific commands.

## Technical Design Decisions
- Use Node.js built-ins for HTTP to avoid heavy dependencies.
- For impersonation, may need to fork or create a custom library for TLS fingerprinting.
- Separate concerns: core client, impersonation module, utils.
- Async-first design with Promises.

## Risk Mitigation
- Impersonation may be complex; start with basic headers and expand.
- Performance: Profile and optimize bottlenecks.
- Compatibility: Test across Node.js versions and browsers.

## Timeline and Milestones
- Phase 1: 1 week
- Phase 2-3: 4 weeks
- Phase 4-5: 3 weeks
- Phase 6-7: 2 weeks
- Total: ~10 weeks for MVP.

## Team Roles
- Planning Agent: Oversee planning and documentation.
- Coding Team Lead: Review technical design.
- Research Subagents: Gather info on impersonation techniques.
- Backend Subagents: Implement core logic.
- Testing Subagents: Ensure quality.
