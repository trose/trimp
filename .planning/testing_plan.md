# Testing Plan for Trimp

## Overview
The testing plan for Trimp ensures comprehensive coverage of functionality, performance, and reliability. It includes unit tests, integration tests, performance benchmarks, and manual testing to validate the TypeScript port of the Python primp library.

## Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions, classes, and modules in isolation.
- **Integration Tests**: Test interactions between components, including real HTTP requests and impersonation.
- **Performance Tests**: Benchmark against original primp and other HTTP clients.
- **Manual Testing**: Edge cases, browser compatibility, and user scenarios.

## Tools and Frameworks
- **Unit/Integration**: Jest with ts-jest for TypeScript support.
- **Coverage**: Aim for 90%+ code coverage using istanbul.
- **Mocking**: Jest mocks for HTTP requests, external APIs.
- **Performance**: Custom scripts using Node.js performance hooks or benchmark.js.
- **Linting**: ESLint for code quality.

## Test Structure
- **tests/unit/**: Unit tests for core logic, e.g., Client methods, response parsing.
- **tests/integration/**: Tests for full request cycles, impersonation effectiveness.
- **tests/performance/**: Benchmarks for speed, memory usage.
- **tests/manual/**: Scripts for manual verification.

## Key Test Cases
- **Client Functionality**: GET/POST requests, headers, JSON/form data, timeouts.
- **AsyncClient**: Promise resolution, async/await handling.
- **Impersonation**: Header spoofing, TLS fingerprinting validation against test sites.
- **Error Handling**: Network failures, SSL errors, invalid inputs.
- **Cookies/Proxies/Auth**: Persistence, routing, authentication flows.
- **Streaming**: Large responses, multipart uploads.
- **Convenience Functions**: Module-level calls.

## Coverage Goals
- Statement coverage: 90%
- Branch coverage: 85%
- Function coverage: 95%

## Performance Benchmarks
- Compare request times for 100 concurrent requests.
- Memory usage during streaming.
- TLS handshake times with impersonation.

## CI/CD Integration
- Run tests on every PR/commit using GitHub Actions.
- Fail builds on coverage below thresholds.
- Automated performance regression checks.

## Risk and Edge Cases
- Test on multiple Node.js versions (14+).
- Browser environment testing if applicable.
- Stress testing for high concurrency.
- Ethical testing: Avoid real-world scraping; use test servers.

## Timeline
- Unit tests: Alongside implementation.
- Integration/Performance: After core features.
- Full suite: Before release.
