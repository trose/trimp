# Comprehensive Task Checklist for Trimp

## Phase 1: Project Setup
- [ ] Initialize TypeScript project with package.json, tsconfig.json, and directory structure (src/, tests/, docs/)
- [ ] Install and configure dependencies: typescript, jest, eslint, prettier, @types/node, tough-cookie, html-to-text, etc.
- [ ] Set up linting and formatting rules
- [ ] Configure build scripts in package.json (build, test, lint)

## Phase 2: Core HTTP Client Implementation
- [ ] Implement base Client class with synchronous methods: get, post, put, patch, delete, head, options
- [ ] Implement AsyncClient class with Promise-based async methods
- [ ] Add request handling: custom headers, query params, body (JSON, form, binary)
- [ ] Add response handling: status code, headers, content (text, bytes), encoding
- [ ] Implement timeouts and basic error handling (network, SSL, timeout errors)
- [ ] Code review core HTTP client against technical requirements

## Phase 3: Impersonation Features
- [ ] Research TLS JA3/JA4 fingerprinting and HTTP/2 settings for browsers
- [ ] Implement header spoofing for Chrome, Safari, Edge, Firefox, OkHttp
- [ ] Add OS-specific impersonation (Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, iOS)
- [ ] Integrate impersonate and impersonate_os parameters in Client/AsyncClient constructors
- [ ] Test impersonation against fingerprinting sites (e.g., tls.peet.ws)
- [ ] Code review impersonation features against technical requirements

## Phase 4: Advanced Features
- [ ] Add cookie management with tough-cookie (persistent stores, domain handling)
- [ ] Implement proxy support (HTTP/SOCKS5) with http-proxy-agent
- [ ] Add authentication: basic auth, Bearer tokens
- [ ] Support streaming responses (chunked reading)
- [ ] Support multipart/form-data uploads
- [ ] Add environment variable handling (TRIMP_PROXY, custom CA bundles)
- [ ] Implement custom CA certificate support
- [ ] Code review advanced features against technical requirements

## Phase 5: Utilities and Convenience
- [ ] Implement module-level convenience functions: get(), post(), etc.
- [ ] Add HTML-to-text conversion for response.textMarkdown(), textPlain(), textRich()
- [ ] Ensure full API compatibility with original primp

## Phase 6: Testing and Quality Assurance
- [ ] Write unit tests for Client/AsyncClient methods, request/response handling
- [ ] Write unit tests for impersonation, cookies, proxies, auth
- [ ] Write integration tests for real HTTP requests and impersonation effectiveness
- [ ] Run performance benchmarks (request times, memory usage, concurrent requests)
- [ ] Achieve 90%+ code coverage
- [ ] Manual testing for edge cases and browser compatibility

## Phase 7: Documentation and Release
- [ ] Write comprehensive README with installation, API docs, examples
- [ ] Generate TypeScript declaration files (.d.ts)
- [ ] Update AGENTS.md with project-specific commands
- [ ] Final code review of entire codebase against all technical requirements
- [ ] Publish to npm with proper versioning
- [ ] Set up CI/CD with GitHub Actions for automated testing

## Risk Mitigation
- [ ] Test on multiple Node.js versions (14, 16, 18, 20)
- [ ] Handle browser environment if fetch API is used
- [ ] Ethical use: avoid real scraping; use test servers
- [ ] Performance optimization: profile and fix bottlenecks

## Dependencies Checklist
- [ ] typescript: ^5.0.0
- [ ] jest: ^29.0.0
- [ ] @types/node: ^20.0.0
- [ ] tough-cookie: ^4.0.0
- [ ] html-to-text: ^9.0.0
- [ ] http-proxy-agent: ^7.0.0 (for proxies)
- [ ] socks-proxy-agent: ^8.0.0 (for SOCKS5)
- [ ] eslint, prettier, etc.

This checklist ensures all technical requirements are met, with strong separation of concerns and parallel development opportunities.
